We want to make a flask application that recommends movies

## Steps:
- create a remote repo and clone it to your git-untracked local directory
- create a virtual environment
- install flask
- start a `.py` script that runs flask
- run the script and open a localhost server

# Sections
- The project has several sections.
- Each section shall have its own git branch for easier tracking
